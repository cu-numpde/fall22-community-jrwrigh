# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: PETSc

PETSc is the Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computing. It is a
large library with various sub-modules for assisting in the computation of PDE
and optimization problems. It does everything from linear algebra, to
differential equation methods, to distributed data types, and even can handle
discretization handling.

The primary audience for the software are people who *build* large scale,
scientific computing programs. It has examples of solving specific problems,
but it's really made to be a library used to solve specific problems. As such,
it doesn't have much domain-specific functions or terminology.
